[![Dashboard Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400?text=Music+Streaming+Dashboard)](https://music-platforms-2024.streamlit.app/)

## Overview

This interactive Streamlit dashboard analyzes music streaming trends across various platforms. The application visualizes top artists, streaming patterns, platform correlations, and popularity trends using comprehensive music streaming data.

## Features

The dashboard is organized into four main tabs:

### 1. Overview
- Display total songs and unique artists in the dataset
- Show top songs by Spotify streams
- Visualize song releases per year
- Highlight top 10 artists by track count with their most popular songs

### 2. Trends and Events in Music Platforms
- Track streaming performance across YouTube, Spotify, TikTok and other platforms
- Visualize key industry events with annotations
- Compare platform growth with percentage change indicators
- Analyze streaming platform trends from 2015 to 2024

### 3. Platform Correlation
- Explore correlations between different streaming platforms with an interactive heatmap
- Generate scatter plots comparing metrics from different platforms
- Filter by top songs across selected platforms
- Normalize data to handle different scales

### 4. Artist Popularity Trend
- Compare the popularity trajectories of selected artists
- Analyze track release patterns over time
- View detailed artist performance metrics and best songs

## Data

The dashboard uses a comprehensive dataset (`data_project_final_2.csv`) containing information about:
- Songs and their artists
